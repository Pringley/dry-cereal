Overview

Making a Character
------------------

Build your character from a starting pool of 20 **character points**. You can
spend character points on Knacks, Techniques, and Extras.

**Knacks** represent broad talents or abilities, like "Close Combat" or
"Acrobatics." A **Mediocre [+0]** Knack costs 1 character point, **Good [+2]**
costs 4 points, and **Excellent [+4]** costs 16 points. (Untrained Knacks are
treated as **Basic [-2]**.)

----
Modifier                Cost (as Knack)
-----------------       -------------------
Basic [-2]              -

Mediocre [+0]           1 character point

Good [+2]               4 character points

Excellent [+4]          16 character points
----

**Techniques** are specific, practiced actions that your character has mastered
-- for example, "pick a lock" or "do a roundhouse kick." Each technique costs 1
character point.

**Extras** cover anything and everything else, from "Filthy Rich" to
"Teleportation." Any special power, background, or possession is an Extra.
Point costs for some common Extras are listed later in this document, but ask
your Game Master about making up your own.

Taking Action
-------------

When a character takes action, his or her degree of success is measured by a
**Margin**, which can be determined in one of several ways.

The player can decide how to approach the task:

1. **Use a Technique**

    If the task is one of the character's Techniques, he or she can
    automatically use a Margin of **Good [+2]**.

2. **Use a Knack**

    Instead, if the task falls under a use case for one of the character's
    Knacks, he or she can simply use the Knack's Modifier as the success
    Margin. For example, a character with *Mediocre [+0] Close Combat* can
    automatically throw a Mediocre [+0] punch.

3. **Roll for it!**

    Finally, if the task requires a Margin higher than the character can
    achieve automatically, they can roll for it. First, the player rolls **two
    six-sided dice** and adds them together. If the character has a relevant
    Knack, add its Modifier to the total. (A Technique counts as a modifier of
    **Good [+2]**. If the character has no relevant Knack or Technique, use
    **Basic [-2]**.)

    The amount by which the total exceeds **seven** is the resulting Margin.

    ----
    Margin                  Minimum total
    -----------------       ---------------
    Basic [-2]              5

    Mediocre [+0]           7

    Good [+2]               9

    Excellent [+4]          11
    ----

### Aiding and Hindering

Characters can also **Aid** or **Hinder** the actions of others. Treat this
like a new task and calculate the character's Margin, either automatically
through a Knack or Technique or by rolling for it (player's choice).

If the Margin is greater than zero, then the player can choose to Aid or Hinder
the original acting character. If Aid is chosen, then this new Margin is
*added* to the original character's; if Hinder, it is *subtracted*.

Improvement
-----------

Characters gain experience over time in the form of additional character
points. One character point can come from any of the following:

- a few days of dangerous experience (battle, adventuring)
- a few weeks of dedicated training (full-time school, apprenticeship)
- a few months of recreational practice (hobby, night school)

Your GM will let you know when you've earned a new character point.
