Hi there! This document contains the core rules for *Dry Cereal*, a tabletop
roleplaying game.  If you're familiar with this type of game, jump right in to
the Quick Start section below. If the rules seem confusing, just keep

Making a Character
------------------

Build your character from a starting pool of 15 **character points**. You can
spend character points on Knacks, Techniques, and Extras.

**Knacks** represent broad talents or abilities, like "Hand-to-Hand Combat" or
"Acrobatics." Every Knack starts with a default value of +0. You can improve a
Knack to the next value by spending that number of character points.  For
example, to improve from +0 to +1, you pay one point; to go from +1 to +2, you
pay two *additional* points (for a total of three).

With a Knack of +1 or +2, your character is **Good**.

At +3 or +4, a Knack is considered **Excellent**.

Finally, a Knack of +5 or +6 is **Formidable**.

**Techniques** are specific, practiced actions that your character has mastered
-- for example, "pick a lock" or "do a roundhouse kick." Each technique costs
two character points.

**Extras** cover anything and everything else, from "Filthy Rich" to
"Teleportation." Any special power, background, or possession is an Extra.
Point costs for some common Extras are listed later in this document, but ask
your Game Master about making up your own.

Taking Action
-------------

To attempt a non-trivial task, first check to see if any of your Knacks or
Techniques apply. If you have a relevant Knack, your chances of success
increase; if you have a relevant Technique, you *automatically* take an
excellent result. (You can only apply one Knack or Technique at a time.)

Start by rolling **three six-sided dice** and adding their results together. If
you have a relevant Knack, add its value to your roll.  The amount by which
your total exceeds **ten** is your **Margin**. This determines how well your
character performs the task.

With a Margin of +1 or +2, your character's performance was **Good**.

At +3 or +4, a Margin is considered **Excellent**.

Finally, a Margin of +5 or +6 is **Formidable**.

If you are using a Technique instead of a Knack, don't roll at all; you
automatically have an Excellent Margin (+4).

### Aiding and Hindering

You can also **Aid** or **Hinder** the actions of other characters. Make a roll
with one of your Knacks, as if you were attempting a task yourself. If your
Margin is greater than zero, then you can choose to Aid or Hinder the acting
character. If you choose to Aid, then your Margin is *added* to their roll; if
you choose to Hinder, it is *subtracted*.

If relevant, Techniques can also be used to Aid and Hinder -- you can
automatically add (or subtract) a Margin of +4.

Improvement
-----------

Characters gain experience over time in the form of additional character
points. One character point can come from any of the following:

- a few days of dangerous experience (battle, adventuring)
- a few weeks of dedicated training (full-time school, apprenticeship)
- a few months of recreational practice (hobby, night school)

Your GM will let you know when you've earned a new character point.
