Overview
========

Making a Character
------------------

Build your character from a starting pool of 20 **character points**. You can
spend character points on Skills, Techniques, and Extras.

**Skills** represent broad talents or abilities, like "Close Combat" or
"Acrobatics." A **Mediocre [+0]** Skill costs 1 character point, **Good [+2]**
costs 4 points, and **Excellent [+4]** costs 16 points. (Untrained Skills are
treated as **Basic [-2]**.)

----
Modifier                Cost (as Skill)
-----------------       -------------------
Basic [-2]              -

Mediocre [+0]           1 character point

Good [+2]               4 character points

Excellent [+4]          16 character points
----

**Techniques** are specific, practiced actions that your character has mastered
-- for example, "pick a lock" or "do a roundhouse kick." Each technique costs 1
character point.

**Extras** cover anything and everything else, from "Super Wealthy" to
"Teleportation." Any special power, background, or possession is an Extra.
Point costs for some common Extras are listed later in this document, but ask
your Game Master about making up your own.

Taking Action
-------------

When a character takes action, his or her degree of success is measured by a
**Margin**, which can be determined in one of several ways.

The player can decide how to approach the task:

1. **Use a Technique**

    If the task is one of the character's Techniques, he or she can
    automatically use a Margin of **Good [+2]**.

2. **Use a Skill**

    Instead, if the task falls under a use case for one of the character's
    Skills, he or she can simply use the Skill's Modifier as the success
    Margin. For example, a character with *Mediocre [+0] Close Combat* can
    automatically throw a Mediocre [+0] punch.

3. **Roll for it!**

    Finally, if the task requires a Margin higher than the character can
    achieve automatically, they can roll for it. First, the player rolls **two
    six-sided dice** and adds them together. If the character has a relevant
    Skill, add its Modifier to the total. (A Technique counts as a modifier of
    **Good [+2]**. If the character has no relevant Skill or Technique, use
    **Basic [-2]**.)

    The amount by which the total exceeds **seven** is the resulting Margin.

    ----
    Margin                  Minimum total
    -----------------       ---------------
    Basic [-2]              5

    Mediocre [+0]           7

    Good [+2]               9

    Excellent [+4]          11
    ----

### Aiding and Hindering

Characters can also **Aid** or **Hinder** the actions of others. Treat this
like a new task and calculate the character's Margin, either automatically
through a Skill or Technique or by rolling for it (player's choice).

If the Margin is greater than zero, then the player can choose to Aid or Hinder
the original acting character. If Aid is chosen, then this new Margin is
*added* to the original character's; if Hinder, it is *subtracted*.

Improvement
-----------

Characters gain experience over time in the form of additional character
points. One character point can come from any of the following:

- a few days of dangerous experience (battle, adventuring)
- a few weeks of dedicated training (full-time school, apprenticeship)
- a few months of recreational practice (hobby, night school)

Your GM will let you know when you've earned a new character point.

Extras
======

Below is a sample list of Extras.

## Ally [1 to 4 points]

An Ally is a reliable friend that will help in time of need. They don't travel
with you (see **Sidekick**), but they can aid from the sidelines.

- **Normal Ally [1 point]**

    A 1-point ally is essentially just a trusted friend who can do you a favor
    from time to time. Normal Allies don't have any special talents or
    connections.

- **Skilled Ally [4 points]**

    You can rely on a Skilled Ally to help in a particular field of problems.
    For example, a friend with black market connections that can get you
    illegal items on the cheap is a Skilled Ally.

## Animal Companion [1 to 4 points]

You have a loyal, trained animal that follows you around! 

- **Small/Harmless Animal [1 point]**

    A scrappy dog or clever falcon, your animal is your friend -- but not much
    help in a fight.

- **Large/Dangerous Animal [4 points]**

    A horse or a venomous snake, your companion isn't one to be trifled with.

If your animal is cinematically intelligent, consider making him or her using
the **Sidekick** rules instead.

## Attractive [4 points]

You are *very* good-looking. Strangers will constantly fawn over you, offering
hospitality or help much more easily than to a regular person.

## Sidekick [4 or more points]

A Sidekick is basically a second character that travels with you. A talentless
Sidekick costs **4 points**. Once you've spent those points to get a Sidekick,
you can spend additional points to give him or her Skills, Techniques, and
Extras (just as you would yourself).

## Speak Language [1 point]

Although all characters are assumed able to speak a common tongue, Speak
Language allows you to speak an additional language. (You can take Speak
Language several times, once for each new language).

## Special Item [4 to 16 points]

Your character starts with basic equipment that makes sense for your concept,
as long as it's not too rare or expensive. You can use this Extra to get a
special something for your character concept.

- **Rare or Illegal Item [4 points]**

    You own an illegal bazooka or a magical flaming sword. This can also be
    used to own something relatively far out of your price range, like a really
    fancy car or boat.

- **Legendary Item [16 points]**

    This is something that will change the game significantly. It could be a
    castle, battleship, or time machine.

## Wealth [4 to 16 points]

All characters have a basic amount of money without taking an Extra --
typically just enough to live on. If you want to have extra wealth or income,
you can take one of the following:

- **Rich [4 points]**

    You might be a successful merchant or banker -- you have more than enough
    money. A Rich character is in the top 10% by wealth.

- **Super Rich [16 points]**

    You are the 1%. You own big houses and drive expensive vehicles. Don't
    bother keeping track of money -- you have more than enough.
