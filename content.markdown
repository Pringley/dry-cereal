Overview
========

Making a Character
------------------

Build your character from a starting pool of 10 **character points**.[^epicalt]
You can spend character points on Skills, Techniques, and Extras.

**Skills** represent broad talents or abilities, like "Close Combat" or
"Acrobatics." A **Intermediate [+0]** Skill costs 1 character point, **Superior
[+2]** costs 4 points, and **Formidable [+4]** costs 16 points.

----
Modifier                Cost (as Skill)
-----------------       -------------------
Basic [-2]              -

Intermediate [+0]       1 character point

Superior [+2]           4 character points

Formidable [+4]         16 character points
----

**Techniques** are specific, practiced actions that your character has mastered
-- for example, "pick a lock" or "do a roundhouse kick." Each technique costs 1
character point.

**Extras** cover anything and everything else, from "Super Wealthy" to
"Teleportation." Any special power, background, or possession is an Extra.
Point costs for some common Extras are listed later in this document, but ask
your Game Master about making up your own.

[^epicalt]: Alternatively, for a high-powered game, build characters from a
starting pool of 20 points. These characters -- closer to seasoned adventurers
-- will have more resources and clout to take on more challenging adventures.

Taking Action
-------------

When a character takes action, his or her degree of success is measured by a
**Margin**, which can be determined in one of several ways.

The player can decide how to approach the task:

1. **Use a Technique**

    If the task is one of the character's Techniques, he or she can
    automatically use a Margin of **Superior [+2]**.

2. **Use a Skill**

    Instead, if the task falls under a use case for one of the character's
    Skills, he or she can simply use the Skill's Modifier as the success
    Margin. For example, a character with *Intermediate [+0] Close Combat* can
    automatically throw a Intermediate [+0] punch.

3. **Roll for it!**

    Finally, if the task requires a Margin higher than the character can
    achieve automatically, they can roll for it. First, the player rolls **two
    six-sided dice** and adds them together. If the character has a relevant
    Skill, add its Modifier to the total. (A Technique counts as a modifier of
    **Superior [+2]**. If the character has no relevant Skill or Technique, use
    **Basic [-2]**.)

    **Skills do not "stack"**; you can choose only one Skill or Technique at a
    time.

    The amount by which the total exceeds **seven** is the resulting Margin.

    ----
    Margin                  Minimum total
    -----------------       ---------------
    Basic [-2]              5

    Intermediate [+0]       7

    Superior [+2]           9

    Formidable [+4]         11
    ----

### Aiding and Hindering

Characters can also **Aid** or **Hinder** the actions of others. Treat this
like a new task and calculate the character's Margin, either automatically
through a Skill or Technique or by rolling for it (player's choice).

If the Margin is greater than zero, then the player can choose to Aid or Hinder
the original acting character. If Aid is chosen, then this new Margin is
*added* to the original character's; if Hinder, it is *subtracted*.

As with normal actions, **you can only Aid/Hinder with one Skill or Technique
at a time**.

Combat
------

In this system, combat is largely up to the GM. Players are encouraged to be as
creative as possible using various Skills, Techniques, and Extras to push for
an advantage.

Improvement
-----------

Characters gain experience over time in the form of additional character
points. One character point can come from any of the following:

- a few days of dangerous experience (battle, adventuring)
- a few weeks of dedicated training (full-time school, apprenticeship)
- a few months of recreational practice (hobby, night school)

Your GM will let you know when you've earned a new character point.

Skills
======

The Ladder
----------

- **Basic [-2]**

    Actions at Basic [-2] level are simple but non-trivial applications of a
    Skill.  These actions are within the reach of laypeople, although not
    reliably so.  Anyone with training can easily and reliably complete Basic
    [-2] actions.

- **Intermediate [+0]**

    These actions are slightly more difficult than Basic [-2]. They are still
    within the reach of untrained characters, but generally take three or four
    attempts.

    Intermediate [+0] is the first available level of Skill. It costs one
    character point, which is equivalent to a few weeks of dedicated training
    (or a few months of pursuit as a hobby). At Intermediate [+0] Skill, the
    character has mastered the fundamentals of the Skill -- he or she can
    accomplish Basic [-2] and Intermediate [+0] actions without rolling.

- **Superior [+2]**

    Superior [+2] actions require talent and practice. An untrained character
    will almost never achieve Superior [+2] results. Even characters with
    Intermediate [+0] Skill have a low chance of success (only 1 in 4).

    Acquiring a Superior [+2] Skill can take months or years of dedicated
    effort.

- **Formidable [+4]**

    When an action is Formidable [+4], it will challenge even characters with
    Superior [+2] skill. These should be used sparingly by the GM, representing
    far-fetched or extraordinary attempts.

    A character who has managed to reach Formidable [+4] level in a Skill is a
    force to be reckoned with, capable of effortlessly performing extraordinary
    tasks.

List of Skills
==============

## Deception

The Deception skill represents the ability to fool other characters.

It is primarily used to Hinder other characters' Skills, such as when they use
Perception to detect lies. (If no one is suspicious or thinks to use
Perception, then your lie simply works!)

## Defensive Skill (specific)

When you take a defensive skill, choose the type of defense you want it to
apply to (dodge, shield, etc). (You can take this skill multiple times for
multiple types of defense.)

This Skill is primarily useful for Hindering attacks.

## Knowledge Skill (specific)

When you take a knowledge skill, choose the type of knowledge you want it to
apply to (History, Nature, etc). (You can take this skill multiple times for
multiple types of knowledge.)

- **Basic [-2] Actions**
    - Recall common-knowledge trivia about the domain.
- **Intermediate [+0] Actions**
    - Recall important facts from the domain -- anything that someone who
      "knows about X" should know.
- **Superior [+2] Actions**
    - Recall rare or obscure information.
- **Formidable [+4] Actions**
    - Recall extremely specific or actively secret knowledge.

action or give up something.

- **Basic [-2] Actions**
    - Convince someone to do something that would be in their best interest
      anyway.

    - Convince someone to do something that wouldn't hurt them or cost them
      anything.
    - Haggle a fair trade.

      or cost them much.
    - Haggle a trade significantly in your favor.

## Medicine

The Medicine skill represents non-magical healing expertise (consistent with
the setting).

- **Basic [-2] Actions**
    - Correctly bandage a wound, stop bleeding. (Failure might make it worse!)

    - Safely perform routine surgical techniques.
- **Formidable [+4] Actions**
    - Safely perform complicated or dangerous surgical techniques.

## Melee Weapon Skill (specific)

**Hindered by:** Defensive Skill, Melee Weapon Skill, Unarmed Combat

When you take a melee weapon skill, choose the weapon you want it to apply to.

## Perception

**Hindered by:** Stealth, Deception

This Skill allows your character to notice things most others don't, like a
secret door or a person who is lying.

Perception is often a *passive* Skill, where the GM assumes you take an
automatic success using your Skill level as your Margin. If you want to look
closer, you can always roll Perception. (A rolled Perception lower than your
Skill won't count!)

- **Basic [-2] Actions**
    - Notice all main features and exits of a room. (Untrained characters who
      roll lower than a Basic [-2] Perception result might miss some exits,
      etc.)
- **Intermediate [+0] Actions**
    - Notice a person hidden in a partially obscured location (such as a
      shadowy corner).
    - Notice a person sneaking up behind you.
    - Detect a complicated or hard-to-believe lie.
- **Superior [+2] Actions**
    - Notice a person hidden out of view (such as behind a door).
    - Detect a slightly far-fetched but still believable lie.
- **Formidable [+4] Actions**
    - Notice a well-hidden feature in a room, such as a secret door.
    - Detect a straightforward lie which makes internal sense.

- **Formidable [+4] Actions**
    - Wound an armored foe within range of your weapon.
    - Kill an unarmored foe within range of your weapon.

## Stealth

Stealth allows your character to hide or move without being noticed. It is most
often used to hinder other characters' passive Perception Margins.

## Unarmed Combat

**Hindered by:** Defensive Skill, Melee Weapon Skill, Unarmed Combat

- **Intermediate [+0] Actions**
    - Wound a helpless foe.

List of Extras
==============

Below is a sample list of Extras.

## Ally [1 to 4 points]

An Ally is a reliable friend that will help in time of need. They don't travel
with you (see **Sidekick**), but they can aid from the sidelines.

- **Normal Ally [1 point]**

    A 1-point ally is essentially just a trusted friend who can do you a favor
    from time to time. Normal Allies don't have any special talents or
    connections.

- **Skilled Ally [4 points]**

    You can rely on a Skilled Ally to help in a particular field of problems.
    For example, a friend with black market connections that can get you
    illegal items on the cheap is a Skilled Ally.

## Animal Companion [1 to 4 points]

You have a loyal, trained animal that follows you around! 

- **Small/Harmless Animal [1 point]**

    A scrappy dog or clever falcon, your animal is your friend -- but not much
    help in a fight.

- **Large/Dangerous Animal [4 points]**

    A horse or a venomous snake, your companion isn't one to be trifled with.

If your animal is cinematically intelligent, consider making him or her using
the **Sidekick** rules instead.

## Attractive [4 points]

You are *very* good-looking. Strangers will constantly fawn over you, offering
hospitality or help much more easily than to a regular person.

## Scary [4 points]

Your appearance is *extremely* intimidating. Strangers will tend to do what you
say out of simple fear.

## Sidekick [4 or more points]

A Sidekick is basically a second character that travels with you. A talentless
Sidekick costs **4 points**. Once you've spent those points to get a Sidekick,
you can spend additional points to give him or her Skills, Techniques, and
Extras (just as you would yourself).

## Speak Language [1 point]

Although all characters are assumed able to speak a common tongue, Speak
Language allows you to speak an additional language. (You can take Speak
Language several times, once for each new language).

## Special Item [4 to 16 points]

Your character starts with basic equipment that makes sense for your concept,
as long as it's not too rare or expensive. You can use this Extra to get a
special something for your character concept.

- **Rare or Illegal Item [4 points]**

    You own an illegal bazooka or a magical flaming sword. This can also be
    used to own something relatively far out of your price range, like a really
    fancy car or boat.

- **Legendary Item [16 points]**

    This is something that will change the game significantly. It could be a
    castle, battleship, or time machine.

## Wealth [4 to 16 points]

All characters have a basic amount of money without taking an Extra --
typically just enough to live on. If you want to have extra wealth or income,
you can take one of the following:

- **Rich [4 points]**

    You might be a successful merchant or banker -- you have more than enough
    money. A Rich character is in the top 10% by wealth.

- **Super Rich [16 points]**

    You are the 1%. You own big houses and drive expensive vehicles. Don't
    bother keeping track of money -- you have more than enough.
